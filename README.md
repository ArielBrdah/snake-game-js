Snake Game
Overview
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in [your language or technology used]. The player controls a snake that grows longer each time it eats food. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score by eating as much food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

Features
Classic snake gameplay.
Randomly generated food that increases the snake's length.
Score tracking system.
Game over when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
Technologies
[Language/Framework used] (e.g., JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas)
[Other libraries or dependencies]
How to Play
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will move continuously in the direction chosen.
Eat the food (small squares) that appear randomly on the screen.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and your score increases.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body – doing so will end the game.
